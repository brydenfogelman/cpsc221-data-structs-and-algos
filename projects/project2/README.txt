New functions:

max_heap::print_heap(int node, int d)

We have implemented a print_heap function to display results when testing.
This function is just used for testing and makes it easier to debug and 
explain results. In practice we would want to use asserts but for the purpose
of this project, printing the heap is more useful. The code for this
function is the same as what was used in the binaryHeap lab.

max_heap.cpp & max_heap.hpp were modified to accomodate this function.
